    <p>This is my go-to recipe for spaghetti and meatballs. With a quick 45-minute cook time,<br>
    itâ€™s perfect for busy weeknights and sure to please even the pickiest eaters. The<br>
    meatballs are juicy and packed with flavor, with a fork-tender texture that keeps<br>
    everyone coming back for more. To make things easy and save on mess, I brown the<br>
    meatballs in the oven on a sheet pan instead of pan-frying them on the stovetop. I also<br>
    use a good quality store-bought marinara sauce to save time, but feel free to use the link below</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <p>Begin with the meatballs:</p>
    <p>1. In a large bowl, combine the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt,
    pepper, garlic and water; whisk well.</p>
    <p>2. Add the meat, breadcrumbs and Parmigiano Reggiano. meatball recipe</p>
    <p>3. Mix with your hands until just combined.</p>
    <p>4. Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs, and place on an ungreased baking sheet.</p>
    <p>5. Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove the baking sheet from the oven and use a metal spatula or tongs to turn the meatballs</p>
    <p>6. Put the meatballs back in the oven and cook for another 10 minutes, until they are nicely browned and almost cooked through.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, bring the marinara sauce to a simmer in a large skillet. Taste it and<br>
        adjust the seasoning if necessary (I usually add a healthy pinch of sugar and some<br>
        freshly ground black pepper). Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce,<br>
        leaving the fat behind. Cover loosely with a lid or foil and simmer for about 10 minutes, <br>
        until the flavors marry and the meatballs are cooked through. Keep warm until ready to toss with pasta.
    </p>
    <p>While the meatballs are cooking, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.</p>
    <p>Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Drain, then toss with the sauce and meatballs.</p>
    <p>Transfer the spaghetti and meatballs to serving bowls and top with fresh chopped basil and more grated cheese.</p>
    <p>Now enjoy!</p>
